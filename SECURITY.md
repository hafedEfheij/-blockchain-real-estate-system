# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Blockchain Real Estate System and best practices for users.

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- **Ownership**: Contracts use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` pattern for administrative functions
- **Verifiers**: Only authorized verifiers can verify properties
- **Property Ownership**: Only property owners can list, unlist, or tokenize their properties

### Reentrancy Protection
- All functions that transfer funds use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
- State changes occur before external calls
- Proper checks-effects-interactions pattern implementation

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Property IDs are checked for existence
- Address validation for all participants
- Price validation to prevent zero or negative values

### Transaction Security
- Escrow mechanism holds funds until transaction completion
- Multi-signature requirements for transaction completion
- Automatic refunds for cancelled transactions
- Time-locked transactions for cooling-off periods

## Frontend Security

### Wallet Connection
- Secure Web3Modal integration
- Proper error handling for connection failures
- Network validation to ensure correct blockchain connection
- Account change detection and automatic reconnection

### Data Validation
- Client-side input validation before blockchain submission
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Proper handling of blockchain responses

## User Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security
1. **Never share your private keys or seed phrase**
2. **Use hardware wallets for large amounts**
3. **Keep your MetaMask updated**
4. **Use strong passwords for your wallet**
5. **Enable two-factor authentication where possible**

### Transaction Safety
1. **Always verify transaction details before confirming**
2. **Check gas fees before submitting transactions**
3. **Use test networks for learning and testing**
4. **Double-check recipient addresses**
5. **Start with small amounts when testing**

### Property Registration
1. **Verify property ownership before registration**
2. **Use secure document storage (IPFS recommended)**
3. **Keep backup copies of all documents**
4. **Ensure legal compliance in your jurisdiction**

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- Contract addresses are hardcoded (update needed for production)
- Limited to single-signature transactions
- No built-in dispute resolution mechanism
- Basic KYC/AML compliance

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Multi-signature wallet integration**
2. **Oracle integration for property valuation**
3. **Enhanced dispute resolution system**
4. **Advanced KYC/AML procedures**
5. **Insurance integration**

## Audit Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment
1. **Professional smart contract audit**
2. **Penetration testing of frontend**
3. **Gas optimization review**
4. **Legal compliance review**
5. **User acceptance testing**

### Ongoing Security
1. **Regular security updates**
2. **Monitoring for suspicious activities**
3. **Bug bounty program**
4. **Community security reviews**

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Issue
1. **Do not use the affected functionality**
2. **Document the issue with screenshots**
3. **Report to the development team immediately**
4. **Do not disclose publicly until resolved**

### Emergency Procedures
- Contract pause functionality for critical issues
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms
- Communication channels for urgent updates

## Compliance

### Legal Considerations
- Property laws vary by jurisdiction
- Digital signature validity
- Tax implications of blockchain transactions
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data minimization principles
- User consent for data processing
- Right to data deletion

## Security Updates

This document will be updated as new security measures are implemented and as the threat landscape evolves. Users are encouraged to:

1. **Stay informed about updates**
2. **Follow security best practices**
3. **Report any security concerns**
4. **Participate in security discussions**

## Contact

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities, please contact the development team through the appropriate channels outlined in the main README.

**Remember: Security is a shared responsibility between the platform and its users.**
